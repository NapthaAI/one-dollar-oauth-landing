# Rules for UI Testing with Playwright
Use the playwright MCP tools for testing the user interface when you work on it. 

## Dev server
The bun development server in package.json is always running with hot reloading, so there is NEVER any need to run `npm run dev` or `npm run build`. Never run either of these commands. 

## Logging in 
When you're ready to look at a UI or test it, navigate to the app on `http://localhost:3000/` (next.js) or `http://localhost:8080` (vite). 


## Tool preferences & configurations
Remember to always use the following options:
- default viewport (of launch options): use 1920 width and 1080 height
- headless mode: always enable this to avoid interrupting my workflow.
